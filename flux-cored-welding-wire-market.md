<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flux Cored Welding Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-shielded</li><li>Self-shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flux-cored welding wire market consists of two primary types: gas-shielded and self-shielded. Gas-shielded flux-cored wires require an external shielding gas to protect the weld pool from contamination, offering a smooth, high-quality finish and improved arc stability. They are ideal for outdoor applications with mild wind. In contrast, self-shielded flux-cored wires contain a flux that generates shielding gas during the welding process, making them suitable for windy conditions and providing versatility for various welding tasks without needing external gas.</p></p>
