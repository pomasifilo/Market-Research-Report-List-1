<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Response Accelerometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Charge Mode Piezoelectric</li><li>Voltage Mode Piezoelectric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AC response accelerometer market primarily consists of two types: charge mode piezoelectric and voltage mode piezoelectric accelerometers. Charge mode piezoelectric accelerometers generate an electrical charge proportional to applied acceleration, making them ideal for high-frequency applications due to their wide bandwidth and sensitivity. In contrast, voltage mode piezoelectric accelerometers convert mechanical stress directly into a voltage signal, providing a more stable output for lower frequency measurements. Both types are essential for various applications including structural monitoring, industry testing, and automotive diagnostics.</p></p>
