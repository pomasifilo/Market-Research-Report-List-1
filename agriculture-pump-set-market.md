<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Pump Set Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agriculture pump set market includes two primary types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water, making them ideal for high flow applications with low viscosity fluids. They are commonly used for irrigation and drainage. On the other hand, displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, providing a steady flow, which is useful for applications requiring high pressure. Both types are essential for efficient water management in agriculture.</p></p>
