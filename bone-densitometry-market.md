<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-Ray Bone Densitometry</li><li>Ultrasonic Bone Densitometry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone densitometry market is primarily categorized into two types: X-ray bone densitometry and ultrasonic bone densitometry. X-ray bone densitometry, also known as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), uses low-dose X-rays to measure bone mineral density, providing precise evaluations critical for diagnosing osteoporosis. In contrast, ultrasonic bone densitometry employs high-frequency sound waves to assess bone density without radiation exposure, offering a safer and more portable alternative, though generally less accurate. Both types play crucial roles in bone health assessment and management.</p></p>
